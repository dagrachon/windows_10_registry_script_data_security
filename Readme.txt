Readme:

The registry script was written to make sure that windows 10 is usable in a company environment 
(without having an active directory running :(... ) and to minimize the data microsoft tries to collect.

Warning! Be careful!
Manipulating the Windows Registry might corrupt your system! 
Always make sure to have backups of the source configuration!

Further informations about the registry keys and / or GPOs are found here:

My used registry keys are commented in the script.

Usage:

Make a backup of your current registry configuration!!
Download the .reg on to your local machine and double-click it (as administrator) to deploy the registry changes.
